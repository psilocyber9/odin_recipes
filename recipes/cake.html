            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt unsweetened chocolate in top of a double boiler<br>
                over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping<br>
                down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.<br>
                Set aside to cool slightly, about 5 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).<br>
                Line two 9-inch cake pans with waxed paper.</li><br>
            <li>Sift cake flour, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.</li><br>
            <li>Whisk sugar, water, vegetable oil, vanilla extract,<br>
                and balsamic vinegar in a large bowl until well-combined.<br>
                Stir in half of the sifted flour mixture. Fold in melted chocolate.<br>
                Stir in remaining sifted flour mixture. Beat with an electric mixer<br>
                on medium speed until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes.<br>
                Divide batter between cake pans.</li><br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until toothpicks inserted in the centers<br>
                come out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pans, 5 minutes. <br>
                Invert cakes onto wire rack and let cool completely before frosting,<br>
                about 1 hour.</li>
